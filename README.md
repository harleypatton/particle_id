## Abstract
Particle identification using the energy loss in silicon detectors is a powerful technique for probing the Standard Model (SM) as well as searching for new particles beyond the SM. Traditionally, such techniques use the truncated mean of the energy loss on multiple layers, in order to mitigate heavy tails in the charge fluctuation distribution. We show that the optimal scheme using the charge in multiple layers significantly outperforms the truncated mean. Truncation itself does not significantly degrade performance and the optimal classifier is well-approximated by a linear combination of the truncated mean and truncated variance.
